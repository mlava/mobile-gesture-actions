Add swipe gestures and double tap / long press to your Roam Research mobile experience.

**New:**
- updated code to ensure keyboard shortcuts fire
- fixed multiple bugs in assigning actions
- added pinch and rotate gesture recognition in addition to swipe left, swipe right, double press and long press

*Previously: keyboard shortcuts!*
- Create a keyboard shortcut to trigger with a gesture.
  - Configure this in the Roam Depot settings
  - the first field is for the letter, number or other key for the shortcut
    - this can be any letter (a-z), number (0-9), one of leftArrow, upArrow, rightArrow, downArrow, or any of ; , . / - =
  - the next two select menus allow you to set Ctrl/Meta, Shift and Alt/Opt
  
This can be used to trigger any action for which you have a hotkey set in Roam Research settings.

This extension allows you to define actions to perform when it recognises:
- swipe left
- swipe right
- double tap
- long press

Actions to select include:
- go to Today's DNP
- go back one DNP
- go forward one DNP
- refresh
- undo
- redo
- toggle Right Sidebar
- toggle Left Sidebar
- open Command Palette
- trigger a keyboard shortcut

If you are not on a daily note page and you trigger go back or go forward one DNP, it will go to yesterday or tomorrow. If you are on a DNP it will go back or forward by one day relative to the current page.

New actions can be added on request.

Note that swipe up and down have not been included as they are already required for scrolling within Roam pages. If someone has a compelling reason why they need these gestures, I will be happy to add them as options.
